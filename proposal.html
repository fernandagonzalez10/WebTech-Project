    <h3>What is the objective of this website?</h3>
    <p>
      I have always been passionate about baking and this project serves as a
      treasury of the enjoyment of consumable masterpieces. The objective of
      this website is to share amazing recipes with those who share my same
      passion. I want to provide a guide on how to create simple yet delicious
      treats for the intended audience's recreational purposes. In addition to
      providing detailed instructions, tips, and tricks, I also intend to
      provide idea recipes that celebrate my personal view and traditions
      towards baking.

    <h3>Who is the target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      The target audience of my project are amateur bakers who share my same
      passion for baking. These individuals are looking for easy-to-follow
      recipes that have ingredients that are easily accessible to all. This
      webpage can appeal to anyone who has the minimum interest in learning the
      basics of baking and wants to learn how to do it on their own.

      preparation/cooking time, the difficulty level, the cuisine where the dish
      originated from, the procedure, any useful recommendations, a picture of
      the dish.
